# Arbitrage Command Line Interface Program

This is an unfinished project that I'm working on. Please understand this is not usable for production yet.

# Its goal:

- Allowing a user to connect their exchange API keys to interact and swap/send from the CLI
- Live feed of crypto prices on connected exchanges

# Current exchange focus:

- Jupiter (SOL)
- Uniswap (ETH)
- Pancakeswap (BNB)

After completing these 3 exchanges for production I will widen the focus on exchanges like MEXC, Binance, and so on.

# Timescale

It may take me some time  to finish this. Apologies upfront :)
